Radiant Resurgence is a wave-based survival game. After a nuclear war defending our democracy, the government designed a special forces unit known as “CSP” to wipe out mutants/creatures created by the fallout of the bombs. After your squad gets ambushed, you are the only one left and it's up to you to complete the mission and survive. You will have to stand your ground and SURVIVE.
